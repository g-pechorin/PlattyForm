Based on [this tweet][ioUP], I spent ... 30 minutes? Maybe? putting together an example of moving platforms in Unity3D.

> This writeup took longer.

The approach here uses two behaviour classes to achive the classical effect of moving platforms that follow some path.

1. mark some empty [GameObject][u3dGO]s as [`Waypoint`][ghWaypoint] instances by attaching the script
1. give each [`Waypoint`][ghWaypoint] a `next` field
1. attach a [`Mover`][ghMover] instance to your platform(s)
	- drag the platform towards the next [`Waypoint`][ghWaypoint] at a fixed rate
	- when you've reached the [`Waypoint`][ghWaypoint], continue with its next one

My example;

- uses the concept of `fuel` to avoid losing movement when fast moving platforms don't have far to travel
- provides some [`Gizmo`][u3dGizmos] logic to make looking at it easier

Normal Unity3D [Rigidbody][u3dRigid] instaces will impact with normal cubes - so if your platforms have a collider you're all set.
If you need-need [Rigidbody][u3dRigid] platforms; you can make them [`Kinematic`][u3dKinematic] to avoid weirdness.

The platform will stop when it reaches the "last" [`Waypoint`][ghWaypoint] so you could modify the [`Mover`][ghMover] to move backwards, or, just have the last platform point to the first platform and create a loop.
